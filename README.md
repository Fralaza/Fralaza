## Hi!

PhD in community ecology at the Gjærevoll Centre, NTNU Trondheim (Norway). I study patterns of species distribution in Norway with help of JSDMs. 
My work combines field work, insect ID in the lab, statistical modelling and ecological theory, to contribute to the understanding of a fundamental question: "Why species are where they are?"

[Research Interests]
- Joint species distribution modelling
- Effects of Land Use and Land Use Changes on Biodiversity
- Contribute to policy implementation and relevance

[Tools and Methods] 
- Statistical Modelling (R)
- Bayesian inferences, multivariate analyses
- National Biodiversity Monitoring Programmes
- National Ecosystem Mapping Schemes 

[Projects and Publications]
- Ecosystem Trøndelag (Monitoring of Biodiversity Trøndelag)
- Other projects at the Gjærevoll Centre (https://www.ntnu.no/gjaerevoll/)
